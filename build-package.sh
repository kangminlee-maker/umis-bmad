# Task: Calculate Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

## Overview
Calculate the Serviceable Addressable Market using multiple methods to ensure accuracy through convergence.

## Methods

### 1. Top-Down Approach
- Start with Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- Apply market share assumptions
- Filter by serviceable segments

### 2. Bottom-Up Approach  
- Count potential customers
- Multiply by average revenue per customer
- Sum across segments

### 3. Value Theory Approach
- Identify value created
- Estimate customer willingness to pay
- Calculate capturable value

### 4. Comparable Analysis
- Find similar markets
- Adjust for local factors
- Validate with primary data

## Process
1. Gather data for each method
2. Calculate independently
3. Compare results
4. Analyze convergence
5. Document assumptions

## Output
- SAM calculation spreadsheet
- Method comparison
- Convergence analysis
- Confidence assessment

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
./install-umis.sh
```

### 2. First Project
```bash
/UMIS *activate MOwner
*kickoff "Your Market Name"
*workflow market-entry-analysis
```

## Agent Commands Reference

## Workflow Patterns

### Full Analysis (7-10 days)
Best for: Major market entry decisions
```
market-entry-analysis
```

### Quick Assessment (2-3 days)
Best for: Opportunity validation
```
investment-decision
```

### Competitive Intel (3-5 days)
Best for: Competitive positioning
```
competitive-strategy
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always start with MOwner**
   - Creates proper project structure
   - Sets clear objectives

2. **Let agents collaborate**
   - They automatically engage when needed
   - Don't micromanage the process

3. **Trust the quality gates**
   - They prevent moving forward with bad data
   - Address all issues before proceeding

4. **Document everything**
   - MCurator captures knowledge automatically
   - Add your own insights

5. **Use parallel execution**
   - Many phases can run simultaneously
   - Reduces total analysis time

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not responding
```bash
/UMIS *activate [AgentID]
*help
```

### Workflow stuck
- Check quality gate status
- Review validation reports
- Ensure data completeness

### Need help?
- Each agent has `*help` command
- Check logs in `.ai/` directory
- Review documentation in `docs/`
