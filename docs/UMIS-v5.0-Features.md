# UMIS v5.0 - Adaptive Intelligence Features

## 🚀 Overview

UMIS v5.0 introduces **Adaptive Intelligence** capabilities to the Universal Market Intelligence System, enabling flexible and evolving market analysis.

## 🎯 Core Enhancements

### 1. Adaptive Market Intelligence Framework

#### Progressive Clarification Model
- Start with unclear goals (20-30% clarity)
- Discovery Sprint (1-2 days) for rapid exploration
- Goal evolves based on findings

```yaml
initial_goal:
  clarity: 20-30%
  approach: "Exploratory"
  
refined_goal:
  clarity: 80-95%
  approach: "Targeted Analysis"
```

#### Learn → Adjust → Proceed Cycle
- Continuous learning from discoveries
- Real-time strategy adjustment
- Low-cost pivoting in early stages

### 2. Proactive Goal Alignment Monitor

#### Stewart's Enhanced Role
- **Strategic Progress Guardian**
- Real-time monitoring of goal alignment
- Proactive intervention when needed

#### Intervention Triggers
1. **Deep Dive Alert**: Preventing over-focus on details
2. **Data Reality Check**: When assumptions don't match data
3. **Opportunity Emergence**: When better opportunities appear
4. **Analysis Drift**: When straying from objectives

### 3. Progressive Data Integrity System

#### Three-Layer Protection
```
Prevention → Detection → Recovery
```

#### Features
- **Automatic Checkpoints**: On key events
- **Multi-layer Verification**: File, data, and cross-reference checks
- **Instant Recovery**: < 5 minutes to any previous state

## 📊 Workflow Evolution

### v4.0 (Fixed)
```
Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
(7-10 days, rigid structure)
```

### v5.0 (Adaptive)
```
Exploration → Focused Analysis → Convergence
     ↑              ↓
     ← Learn & Adjust ←
(Flexible duration, dynamic structure)
```

## 🔧 Implementation

### Agent Enhancements

#### MCurator (Stewart) - Extended Capabilities
```yaml
enhanced_responsibilities:
  - proactive_goal_monitoring
  - progressive_data_protection
  - adaptive_workflow_orchestration
```
